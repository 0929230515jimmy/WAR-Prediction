# WAR-Prediction
I used fWAR for this prediction. The data is from pybaseball. I extract the data from the 2020-2024 to train the model. Linear Regression is the statistical method employed to project future WAR values. The regression model takes SLG and OPS as independent variables (features) and WAR as the dependent variable (target). The model is fitted to the historical data to understand the relationship between the metrics and WAR. The methodology assumes that a player's SLG and OPS will remain consistent over the next five years, using the mean of the historical values for these metrics. To account for the natural decline in player performance as they age, an aging curve is applied. This curve reduces the projected WAR values gradually from 2025 to 2029, simulating a typical decline in performance for aging athletes.
